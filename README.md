# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description

The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based smart contract built on Ethereum that enables transparent, secure, and tamper-proof elections. This system eliminates the need for traditional centralized voting authorities by leveraging the immutable nature of blockchain technology.

### Key Features:
- **Voter Registration**: Admin can register eligible voters
- **Candidate Management**: Admin can add candidates to the election
- **Secure Voting**: Registered voters can cast their votes only once
- **Transparent Results**: Real-time vote counting and result transparency
- **Election Control**: Admin can start and end elections
- **Winner Declaration**: Automatic determination of election winner

### Core Functions:
1. **registerVoter() & addCandidate()**: Manages voter registration and candidate addition
2. **vote()**: Allows registered voters to cast their votes securely
3. **getResults() & endElection()**: Provides election results and controls election lifecycle

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the democratic process by creating a trustless, transparent, and accessible voting system that:

- **Enhances Democracy**: Eliminates voter fraud and ensures every vote counts
- **Increases Transparency**: All votes are recorded on an immutable public ledger
- **Reduces Costs**: Eliminates the need for expensive physical voting infrastructure
- **Improves Accessibility**: Enables remote voting while maintaining security
- **Builds Trust**: Uses cryptographic proofs instead of trusting centralized authorities
- **Promotes Participation**: Makes voting more convenient and accessible to all eligible citizens

### Long-term Goals:
- Scale to handle national-level elections
- Implement advanced privacy features while maintaining transparency
- Integrate with digital identity systems
- Support multiple election types (referendums, multi-choice voting, ranked choice)
- Provide real-time analytics and reporting
- Ensure compliance with electoral regulations across different jurisdictions

This project represents a step toward a more democratic, transparent, and trustworthy electoral system powered by blockchain technology.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat or Truffle framework
- MetaMask wallet
- Test ETH for deployment

### Deployment:
1. Compile the smart contract
2. Deploy to your preferred network (testnet recommended for testing)
3. Initialize the contract with an election name
4. Register voters and add candidates
5. Start the voting process

### Usage:
1. **Admin Operations**: Register voters, add candidates, end election
2. **Voter Operations**: Cast vote (once per voter)
3. **Public Operations**: View results, check winner, verify votes

## Security Features:
- Access control with admin-only functions
- One vote per registered voter
- Input validation for all functions
- Event logging for transparency
- Modifier-based security checks
